Hello!
<br><br>
I'm primarily a web developer(HTML,CSS,JS,PHP,MYSQL)
<br><br>
I know other languages however I'd say I am most fluent in PHP
<br><br>
I like Rust, C++, and C#(specifically Unity's implementation)
<br><br>
Getting into JavaScript a bit recently!
<br><br>
I love open sourcing everything I make, and I hope you cam find a use out of what I have made!
